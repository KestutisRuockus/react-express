# React + Express CRUD App

This project is a simple full-stack CRUD application built to understand and practice the connection between a React frontend and an Express backend.

The goal of this project was to learn how client-side applications communicate with a backend API using HTTP requests, and how basic CRUD operations are implemented end-to-end.
